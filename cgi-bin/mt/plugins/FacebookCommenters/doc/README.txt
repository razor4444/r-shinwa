OVERVIEW

The Facebook Connect Commenters plugin for Movable Type allows commenters to login to your
blog using their Facebook account.  It makes use of the Facebook Connect APIs to provide a
rich user experience.  Commenters are able to automatically bring their name, profile photo,
and friends with them when commenting on a blog running this plugin.

All of this profile information respects a user's privacy settings from Facebook; if they only
share their profile photo with their friends then it won't be displayed publicly on a blog.
Once a Facebook user has logged in, comments left from other Facebook users will display
additional data.  Profile photos and names that were hidden publicly will now be displayed
assuming the logged in user is able to see them on Facebook.com.  Additionally, comments left
from friends of the user on Facebook will be highlighted.

After leaving a comment, the Facebook user will be given the option to share with their
friends on Facebook that they commented on the blog post.  This in turn should help others
discover your blog.

PLEASE NOTE: Facebook Connect currently requires pre-approval in order for you to launch your
blog integration. As long as you are using the standard blog plugin, this should be painless
and quick â€“ it should take just a few days at the most.   

Check here to see if Facebook Connect is available for launch with out approval: http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Connect_Launch_Plans

If approval is required, go here to submit your blog with Facebook Connect: http://www.facebook.com/connect/submit_site.php

TEMPLATE CODE

To add basic support for Facebook Connect, place the following tag in your Header template
before the closing "head" tag.  This will enable Facebook Connect on your blog, but will not
customize the display of your comments.

  <mt:GreetFacebookCommenters>

To display a Facebook user's profile photo next to their comment, you will have to use a
Comment Detail template which includes userpics.  The following template should work in most
cases and
http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/designer/publishing-comments-with-userpics.html is a
useful guide to adding userpics to your templates.

  <div class="comment"<MTIfArchiveTypeEnabled archive_type="Individual"> id="comment-<$MTCommentID$>"</MTIfArchiveTypeEnabled>>
      <div class="inner">
          <div class="comment-header">
              <div class="user-pic<mt:if tag="CommenterAuthType" eq="Facebook"> comment-fb-<$MTCommenterUsername></mt:if>">

              <mt:if tag="CommenterAuthType" eq="Facebook">
                  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=<$MTCommenterUsername>" class="auth-icon"><img src="<$MTCommenterAuthIconURL size="logo_small"$>" alt="<$mt:CommenterAuthType$>"/></a>
                  <fb:profile-pic uid="<$MTCommenterUsername>" size="square" linked="true"><img src="http://static.ak.connect.facebook.com/pics/q_default.gif" /></fb:profile-pic>

              <mt:else>
                  <mt:if tag="CommenterAuthIconURL">
                      <a href="<$MTCommenterURL>" class="auth-icon"><img src="<$MTCommenterAuthIconURL size="logo_small"$>" alt="<$mt:CommenterAuthType$>"/></a>
                  </mt:if>
                  <img src="<$MTStaticWebPath>images/default-userpic-50.jpg" />
              </mt:if>
              </div>

              <div class="asset-meta">
                  <span class="byline">
                  <mt:if tag="CommenterAuthType" eq="Facebook">
                      By <span class="vcard author"><fb:name uid="<$MTCommenterUsername>" linked="true" useyou="false"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=<$MTCommenterUsername>"><$MTCommenterName></a></fb:name></span> on <a href="#comment-<$MTCommentID$>"><abbr class="published" title="<$MTCommentDate format_name="iso8601"$>"><$MTCommentDate$></abbr></a></span>

  				<mt:else>
  					By <span class="vcard author"><mt:if tag="CommenterURL"><a href="<mt:CommenterURL>"><$MTCommentAuthor default_name="Anonymous" $></a><mt:else><mt:CommentAuthorLink default_name="Anonymous" show_email="0"></mt:if></span><MTIfNonEmpty tag="CommentAuthorIdentity"><$MTCommentAuthorIdentity$></MTIfNonEmpty> on <a href="#comment-<$MTCommentID$>"><abbr class="published" title="<$MTCommentDate format_name="iso8601"$>"><$MTCommentDate$></abbr></a></span>
  				</mt:if>
                  </span>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="comment-content">
              <$MTCommentBody$>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>

The plugin's root directory also has an example file "comment_detail.mtml.example", which is the default Comment Detail template module of the Community Blog template set included in MT 4.23 that also has the functionality to add Facebook userpics described above.  If you are using the default template module without any changes, you can overwrite /path/to/mt/addons/Community.pack/templates/blog/comment_detail.mtml with this file, and refresh the template from the Template Listing screen.

STYLES

While you don't need to customize any of the CSS styles, there are many CSS classes which
can be tweaked to adjust the display of comments.

.comment-friend {
  background-color: #c3cddf;
}
