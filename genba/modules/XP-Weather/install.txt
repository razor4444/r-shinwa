Version 1.3 by davidd
	- same as 1.1, english is the only supported mysql file right now.

Version 1.1 by davidd

installation 1.1:

    - unzip file to modules directory
    - choose mysql.sql file in sql directory for the language you are using (English default)
    - add to site from admin module control panel
    - config.php file contains cache_time variable for setting the time-to-live on the cache data.
	The default is set to 1 hour.  If set to -1 the cache will never be re-freshed.  There is
	the start of a cron job to refresh the cache in the cron directory.

Upgrade:
    - deactivate and un-install old version of XP-Weather module from the admin control panel.
	WARNING!!! - un-installing the old version xp-weather will cause any data you have added to the
	xp-weather tables to be lost.  If you wish to keep that data perform a backup first and re-apply
	the changes after the upgrade.
    - replace contents of modules/XP-Weather with the latest version.
    - install and activate the new XP-Weather module version from the admin control panel.



NOTICE:
    - Don't forget to set the cache directory and files for reading and writting by the webserver account.

	copy them to the fresh directory replacing a file there and the new one will be used.
